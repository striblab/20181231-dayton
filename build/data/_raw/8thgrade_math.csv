"Notes:"
"CAUTION: Mathematics MCA-II and MCA-III test specifications are different."
"MCA-II test specifications are aligned to the 2003 Minnesota Academic"
"Standards; MCA-III test specifications are aligned to the 2007 Minnesota"
"Academic Standards. Users are strongly cautioned against comparing data or"
"drawing conclusions about mathematics achievement between the two tests."
""
"The Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment (MCA), the MCA-Modified, and the"
"Minnesota Test of Academic Skills (MTAS) are state tests that help"
"districts measure student progress toward Minnesota's Academic Standards,"
"the state's definition of what students should know in each grade. These"
"assessments also meet the requirements of the Elementary and Secondary"
"Education Act (ESEA), and mathematics and reading assessments are also used"
"in federal school accountability measurements.  "
""
"Students take one test in mathematics each year in grades 3-8 and in grade"
"11. Most students take the MCA, but students who receive special education"
"services and meet eligibility requirements may take the MCA-Modified or the"
"MTAS. "
""
"Students in grades 3-8 took the mathematics MCA-II until the 2009-2010"
"academic year, and have taken the mathematics MCA-III since the 2010-2011"
"academic year. Students in grade 11 have taken the mathematics MCA-III"
"since the 2013-2014 academic year."
""
"The percentage meeting or exceeding standards indicates the share of"
"students achieving the expectations of the state standards for their grade"
"level. MCA exams are administered during the spring, so the data year"
"represents the second year of an academic school year; for example, 2017"
"data represents the 2016-2017 school year. Data are for public school"
"districts only; excludes all private schools."
""
"School districts are assigned to the counties and regions where their"
"district offices are located. In the cases where districts cross county"
"boundaries, users are encouraged to view the breakdowns “By district.”"
"County-level data is not available for 2006 and 2009. In these years, the"
"county totals are calculated by summing up the data for all districts in"
"the county for which data are available. Districts where data is suppressed"
"to protect privacy are omitted from both the numerator and the"
"denominator."
