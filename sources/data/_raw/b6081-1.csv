The NGA rate permitted students receiving special education and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,recent immigrant students with limited English proficiency to be assigned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"to different cohorts to allow them more time to graduate, while the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Four-Year Graduation Rate does not allow for this. The NGA rate also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,permitted students who graduate with modified high school diplomas to count,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"as graduates, while the Four-Year Graduation Rate excludes any alternative",,,,,,,,,,,,,,degrees that are not fully aligned with a Stateâ€™s academic standards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(e.g., a General Education Development (GED) credential, a modified",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"diploma, or a certificate of attendance).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Minnesota previously made an adjustment to the calculation that removed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,first-time ninth grade students (and other students that had joined the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,cohort) if their enrollment period was very brief. This can occur when a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,student is temporarily placed in an alternative program or other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,specialized educational facility and the grade is reported differently than,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"in the regular school. During a final review, the U.S. Department of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Education indicated that this adjustment was inappropriate and should be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"removed. Students who are served as first-time ninth grade students, even",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"for brief periods of time, are expected to join a cohort and graduate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,within four years. Data in this measure for all available years reflect the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,new standards that include these briefly-enrolled students in the cohort.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sources:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Minnesota Department of Education. http://education.state.mn.us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Data downloaded from http://www.mncompass.org on 04/26/2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
