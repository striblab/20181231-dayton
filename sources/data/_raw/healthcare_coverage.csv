"employer or union; insurance purchased directly from an insurance company;"
"Medicare, Medicaid, Medical Assistance, or any kind of"
"government-assistance plan for those with low incomes or a disability;"
"TRICARE or other military health care; or VA (including those who have ever"
"used or enrolled for VA health care). Note that coverage solely by the"
"Indian Health Service (IHS) does NOT count as health insurance; i.e.,"
"people who were only covered by IHS in the previous year are counted as"
"uninsured."
