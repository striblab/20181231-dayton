      <p>Following an ignominious tenure as a U.S. Senator, Mark Dayton won by a hair’s breadth in 2010’s heavily-contested gubernatorial election as a divisive figure in Minnesota’s politics.</p>

      <p>But time and circumstance were kind to Dayton as the state survived and thrived through recession and difficulty, and he claimed a more decisive victory for reelection in 2014. He now leaves office having boasted relatively high approval ratings throughout his administration.</p>
      
      <p>As Mark Dayton’s eight-year term as Minnesota’s governor comes to an end, here’s a look back at how the state has changed over the course of his administration and those of his predecessors.</p>
